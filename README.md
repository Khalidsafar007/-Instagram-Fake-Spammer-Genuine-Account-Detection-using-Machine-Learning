📌 Instagram Fake, Spammer & Genuine Account Detection using Machine Learning
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) techniques in Python to classify Instagram accounts as Fake, Spammer, or Genuine based on various features. The dataset was collected using a crawler and manually labeled, ensuring high accuracy in identifying fake accounts.

🚀 Project Overview
Fake and spam accounts are a growing challenge on social media platforms like Instagram. This project is a binary classification task that applies Machine Learning (ML) models to differentiate between genuine and fake (spammer) accounts based on their profile attributes.
